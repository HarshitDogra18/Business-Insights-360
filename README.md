## ðŸ”§ Key Features

### 1. Data Modeling and Optimization
To ensure that the dashboard provides accurate and meaningful insights, I built a comprehensive **data model** with relationships that connect various tables efficiently.

- **Power Query** was used to clean and transform data, ensuring all incoming datasets (Excel, CSV, SQL) were standardized and optimized for reporting.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** was employed to create **calculated columns** and **measures**, providing the necessary calculations to support dynamic and flexible reporting based on the data model.

### 2. Optimizing Performance with DAX Studio
I utilized **DAX Studio** to analyze query performance and optimize the dashboard, improving load times by **5%**. This was achieved by eliminating unnecessary columns, reducing complex calculations, and indexing key fields for faster aggregation.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations and Charts
The dashboard includes a variety of **dynamic visuals** and **charts** to give stakeholders a clear understanding of business performance.

- **Line charts** for **year-over-year** sales growth and trends over time.
- **Bar charts** and **stacked column charts** to compare sales performance by region, department, or product.
- **Pie charts** for category-wise sales breakdown.
- **KPI Indicators** to show key metrics like **Revenue**, **Profit**, and **Growth Rate**.
- **Ribbon charts** were used to track and visualize **AtliQ's market share** over time, helping stakeholders understand market positioning and performance against competitors.

### Interactivity:
- **Slicers** and **filters** were implemented for users to drill down into data by **time**, **region**, **department**, and **product category**.
- **Bookmarks** and **dynamic buttons** were set up to create **report navigation** for better user experience.

## ðŸ’¡ Power Query: Data Transformation & ETL
Power Query was used extensively to prepare and transform data before loading it into Power BI:

- **Data Cleansing**: Removed duplicate records, fixed inconsistencies, and standardized column names.
- **Merging Data**: Combined multiple data sources (Excel, CSV, SQL) into a single table, ensuring no discrepancies.
- **Data Aggregation**: Used Power Query's **Group By** feature to aggregate sales data by **Region**, **Product**, and **Time** before performing in-depth analysis.
